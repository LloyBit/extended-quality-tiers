### Infinite Quality Tiers

This mod adds a new infinite technology unlocked with promethium science packs. Each level of the infinite tech grants one extra quality tier.

WARNING: This is the worst mod I have ever made and possibly the worst mod on the entire mod portal.

### Okay, but how can I craft those crazy high levels of quality?

I recommend you to craft the **Stinky quality module 3**

In this mod, once a recipe goes higher than 100% quality it will start skipping tiers while being crafted or recycled.
