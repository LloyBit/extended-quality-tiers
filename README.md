### The original project
https://github.com/notnotmelon/infinite-quality-tiers
Ive enjoyed the idea of this mod so i tried to moderate and simplify it. In my opinion it will be more attractive for common players like me. Great thanks for original author for his work, i hope it will spread wider.

### Changes compared to original
- Reduced amount of external qualities to 6(11 at all, including base qualities). As a consequence some items in final quality will increase their changable properties in 2 or 4 times
- Renamed some qualities, so every higher ones try to sound more considerable
- Increased chance to get higher quality since legendary (from 0.1 to 0.25) just in case to accelerate endgame gameplay

### Extended Quality Tiers

This mod adds a new extended technology unlocked with promethium science packs. Each level of the extended tech grants one extra quality tier. Legendary quality unlocks with researching epic quality

In this mod, once a recipe goes higher than 100% quality it will start skipping tiers while being crafted or recycled.
